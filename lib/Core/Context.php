/**
 * Manages the context variable that is provided to individual tests.
 *
 * The most magical thing this does is to allow tests to shadow / overwrite
 * variables defined in other Blocks without clobbering the previous values.
 *
 * @see test/functional/test_context.php Specifically, the Isolation tests where
 * we assert that a sibling describe block will not use the variables clobbered
 * by a sibling.
 *
 * There's a few advantages to this approach. First, it discourages writing tests
 * that depend on previous test results e.g. by having succesive test that
 * modify the context. Of course, if you've got an an object and you're modifying
 * it's internal state, we don't try to prevent that.
 *
 * Second, the behavior may be exploited. One of the ideas guiding Matura's
 * nesting strategy is you want to be able to move from general to specific,
 * augmenting the context along the way. Two blocks may share a common ancestor
 * that defines some base context and in turn, they can modify this context
 * without affecting each others behavior. You could do this simply through
 * judicious use of before() blocks to establish a 'fresh' context for each and
 * every test case, but sometimes you *do* want a shared context for the purpose
 * of efficiency.
